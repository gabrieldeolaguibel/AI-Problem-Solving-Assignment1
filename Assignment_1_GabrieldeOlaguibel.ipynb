    "- **Manhattan Distance** and **Misplaced Tiles**:\n",
    "  - Both heuristics generally exhibited comparable performance metrics.\n",
    "  - They efficiently guided the A* search, resulting in fewer visited nodes for the given test cases. This suggests that, for simple to moderately complex states, they can find solutions quickly.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Linear Conflict**:\n",
    "  - This heuristic is more sophisticated, incorporating additional knowledge about the problem into its estimates. Specifically, it accounts for tiles that are in the correct row or column but are in conflict.\n",
    "  - As a result, it often visited more nodes than the other two heuristics. This increased number of visited nodes indicates a broader and potentially more exhaustive search.\n",
    "  - The lower branching factor observed with Linear Conflict suggests that, although it might examine more nodes, the paths it explores tend to be less branched. This might be because it's considering more detailed constraints on potential solutions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Overall Takeaway**:\n",
    "  - While Manhattan Distance and Misplaced Tiles provided a more direct approach to finding solutions in our test instances, Linear Conflict's method, though more exhaustive, might be advantageous in puzzles of greater complexity or those that involve more intricate conflicts.\n"
